## What it is built on

- React, redux
- ThreeJS, react-three-fiber
- Material UI
- Fastify (backend)

## How to run it

Clone this repo, type `npm i`, type `npm start`. Since this website requires running backend API that I won't publish for obvoius for me reasons, you'll have to do something with `Failed to fetch` error. Remove fetch or run mock server on specified port.
