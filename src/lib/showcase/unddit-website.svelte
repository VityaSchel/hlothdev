Then went to a bitcoin ATM to get some coins and send it to his wallet. The coins are officially lost because he was trying to send Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash wallet. / You can call it a lie. You can call it misleading. You can call it bootleg. But its not phishing. That's like walking by a place called McDowells and getting their fake big Mac and then reporting them for phishing. Also phishing is meant to steal information or scam people of money. If I fuck up and buy bcash instead of bitcoin I can just trade it in at the fair market rate and get my money back. Point is you're wasting someone's time by trying to report to Google. / There are actually plenty of people confusing this for Bitcoin. So it's like mcdowells making their building LOOK like a McDonald's so that anyone who isn't Mcdonalds savy wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Then they sell you a fake Big Mac and you only realize after you bite into it that you were tricked the whole time.",

	<p>
		Reddit is a social media platform where users can share content and engage
		in discussions.
	</p>
	<h2>The problem</h2>
	<p>
		Reddit allows moderators to delete posts and comments. Authors of content
		can also remove their own posts and comments.
	</p>
	<h2>The solution</h2>
	<p>
		Unddit is a web application that allows users to view removed Reddit posts
		and comments. It works by archiving content that has been deleted from
		Reddit, making it accessible to users who want to see the full context of a
		discussion. By using Unddit, users can bypass the limitations of Reddit's
		content moderation and access a more complete history of conversations.
	</p>
	<h2>Remaking unddit</h2>
	<p>
		In early 2025 I got contacted by the original creator of Unddit, who wanted
		to make a new frontend for the service. The original version was built by
		himself using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was contracted to build a
		modern frontend using Svelte and Tailwind CSS. My project still uses the
		official PullPush API and only replaces the static frontend working
		client-side.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mid 2025 I had to stop working with this client who maintains PullPush
		because of harassment, unethical behavior and significant underpayment. Read
		more on <a href="/showcase/ryo-coin">RYO Coin page</a> in showcase.
