    Looks like you have enabled
    <b class="font-semibold">reduce motion</b>
    setting in your system.

    In case you have enabled it accidentally,
    <a
      href="https://prefers-reduced-motion.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      class="font-semibold"
